This article explores the wheel choices we have for the RC lawn mower.

## Wheel choices
1. Inflated wheels
2. Solid wheels

## Inflated Wheels
### Pros
1. Shock absorbing
2. Gentler on the grass
3. Tube and Tubeless options

### Cons
1. Hard to find exact size
2. Fitment on to hub

## Solid Wheels
### Pros
1. Hub and wheel comes as 1 unit
2. Easier to source from old hoverboard/electric wheelchair

### Cons
1. Electric wheelchair motors and wheels may be expensive
2. Shipping hoverboard wheels cost prohibitive forcing us to use second hand hoverboard wheels
3. If the motor dies the wheel and motor needs to be discarded
4. Prone to wear out faster than inflated tires

## Motor Choices
1. Regular DC motor
2. BLDC - Brushless DC motor


## Regular DC Motors
### Pros
1. Easier to source and generally cheap
2. Simpler electronic driver circuits

### Cons
1. Not very efficient
2. Tend to get hot
3. Need to replace brushes at regular intervals

## BLDC (Brushless DC Motor)
### Pros
1. Very efficient
2. No Maintenance

### Cons
1. Complex and expensive driver circuits

## Conclusion
Given the various choices and options available to me I chose to go with Hoverboard motors. I sourced two $50 hoverboards from Walmart which had tiny 6.5 inch. wheels. These were on the sale and the regular price was $80 each which made it an easy decision for me.
